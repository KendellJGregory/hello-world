# hello-world
My first repository.

Hello, everyone!  My name is Kendell, and I am new to programming.  I have decided to get back into school and get a degree in computer science.  I am nervous, but excited, and hope I can figure all of this out and meet a lot of brilliant and friendly people along the way!
